                Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than
                mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same
                way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it
                may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

            <p> mister wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing, when i'm asked, i don't have to
                lie. but don't think of me as an idiot. circumstances have taught me that a man's ethics are the only
                possessions he will take beyond the grave. well, what is it today? more spelunking? </p>
